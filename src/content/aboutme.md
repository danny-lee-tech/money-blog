<h1>Don't Pay Full Price!</h1>
In 2024, I took a hiatus from my job because my personal TODO list had grown to a point that I was unable to enjoy my day-to-day life without a large amount of guilt.  I had a 9-to-5 job, but when I came home, I didn't have the mental capacity to handle anything else, but the chores I needed to do today.

Other hobbies include:
- Pickleball
- Basketball
- Bowling
- Programming
- Reading

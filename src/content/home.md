<h1>üßë‚ÄçüöÄ Hello, Astronaut!</h1>

Welcome to the official <a href="https://astro.build/">Astro</a> blog starter template. This
template serves as a lightweight, minimally-styled starting point for anyone looking to build
a personal website, blog, or portfolio with Astro.

This template comes with a few integrations already configured in your
<code>astro.config.mjs</code> file. You can customize your setup with
<a href="https://astro.build/integrations">Astro Integrations</a> to add tools like Tailwind,
React, or Vue to your project.

Here are a few ideas on how to get started with the template:
- Edit this page in <code>src/pages/index.astro</code>
- Edit the site header items in <code>src/components/Header.astro</code>
- Add your name to the footer in <code>src/components/Footer.astro</code>
- Check out the included blog posts in <code>src/content/blog/</code>
- Customize the blog post page layout in <code>src/layouts/BlogPost.astro</code>

Have fun! If you get stuck, remember to
